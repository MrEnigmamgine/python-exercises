# Exercises
# Create a file named function_exercises.py for this exercise. After creating each function specified below, write the necessary code in order to test your function.

# Define a function named is_two. It should accept one input and return True if the passed input is either the number or the string 2, False otherwise.

## Checks if a value can be evaluate as the integer 2.
# @param {string OR int} x

# Define a function that accepts a string that is a word. The function should capitalize the first letter of the word if the word starts with a consonant.

## Checks if a string starts with a consonant and is not just a single character. If so capitalize it.

# Additional Exercise
# Once you've completed the above exercises, follow the directions from https://gist.github.com/zgulde/ec8ed80ad8216905cda83d5645c60886 in order to thouroughly comment your code to explain your code.

# Bonus
# Create a function named twelveto24. It should accept a string in the format 10:45am or 4:30pm and return a string that is the representation of the time in a 24-hour format. Bonus write a function that does the opposite.
# Create a function named col_index. It should accept a spreadsheet column name, and return the index number of the column.
# col_index('A') returns 1
# col_index('B') returns 2
# col_index('AA') returns 27
