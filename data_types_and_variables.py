#  You have rented some movies for your kids: 
#   -  The little mermaid (for 3 days), 
#   -  Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), 
#   -  and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it). 
#  If price for a movie per day is 3 dollars, how much will you have to pay?


# Since the scope of this problem is limited to 3 movies and I don't expect any movies to be added to the list, and I don't care about the title or the audiences approval
# AND since the price per day is the same for all movies, I can store the relevant data in a list consisting of the days in integers.
